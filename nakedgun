			"text": "i just saw _The Naked Gun_ at the movies today, and folks, comedy is back. they made comedy legal again. i laughed, i chuckled, i tittled a little, and i even guffawed once or twice!\nthere were nonstop jokess throughout the movie, tough some landed a bit better than others. im not sure about using the r slur like that, the weird snowman scene ran for a bit too long, and the tivo joke just kinda felt out of place. but the nightvision dog sex scene made up for all of that, i think.\nthere were some really good recurring gags that felt right at home with the series. Liam Neeson was able to perfectly deliver those straightman lines that Leslie Nielson was so well known for, and i think playing off the noir internal monologue that Nielsen's character would always do was a really witty twist on the joke. the coffee cups getting progressively more absurd was maybe my favorite part, too!\n the casting decision for Liam Neeson was smart in so many ways, but i really hope one of the main reasons he got picked was just that his name sounds so similar to Leslie Nielson. it's just too perfect. i think they played around his experience with action movies really well. the badass fight scenes with naked gun slapstick humor is a much welcomed addition to the series, personally. it almost has a _Kung Pow: Enter the Fist_ vibe to it. at one point he ejects a magazine from his gun at somebody's face, causing them to spit out a tooth that he loads into his gun and shoots back into their mouth. absolutely wild.\nthe _Naked Gun_ movies are maybe my favorite comedy movies of all time. i was a little worried a reboot in 2025 would be a stain on its legacy, but i am so thankful to say that it was a wonderful modern adaptation! if you wanna crack up and burst out in laughter, i cannot recommend _The Naked Gun_ enough!
