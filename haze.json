			"*Team Reptile - Bomb Rush Cyberfunk*- kinda definitively _the_ 'spiritual successor' to JSR. it's more JSR than the new JSR that's coming out. u gotta check  it out",
			"*2 Mello - Memories of Tokyo-to + Tokyo-to Future*- tribute albums to JSR and JSR Future that got me into 2 Mello's work. super talented musician, honestly check out his whole discography on bandcamp!",
			"*terrivellmann - SLUDGE LIFE*- tbh the only connection between these two is like . graffiti. so it might not rly be inspired by. but it's still a cool game!",
			"*Hayd__N - Jamphibian*- idk if this is ever gonna come out and i havent seen any updates in ages but this porject by hayd__n is definitely worth keeping an eye on!",
			"*Team Trigear - MECHABOP*- another game in development. i actually think 2 Mello has a song that's gonna be used in this game??"
